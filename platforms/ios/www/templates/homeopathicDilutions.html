    <div id="homeopathicDilutions-markdown8" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
      <p style="color:#000000;">In order to make a homeopathic potency, one part of the starting material is added to 9 parts of liquid and vigorously shaken. The resulting solution is the first dilution from the starting material and is called tincture, with the numerical designation of 1X. 
        
      <p>This process is repeated to make additional dilutions of the starting material and with each new dilution the resulting solution is designated with the number of each successive dilution step. The diagram below shows the process where the first 1 to 10 dilution, 1X (Tincture) is further processed to produce higher and higher dilutions.</p>
      <p>For Example:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Arnica 1X is the first dilution made from the roots of Arnica Montana and provides the starting material</li>
        <li>This material is diluted with 9 parts liquid and shaken, resulting in a 2X dilution</li>
        <li>Each successive dilution step is marked below: 3X, 4X and so on. In all cases, the original starting material included Arnica Montana, but the amount of Arnica Montana in the final product is diluted with each step by a factor of 10. So a 30X dilution has gone through 30 dilution steps, each time by a factor of 10.</li>
